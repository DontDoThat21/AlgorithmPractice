This is a project of ranging complexity alghorithms.

To run, set CrosswordSolver as the main startup project.
If you are trying to run the API examples, make sure the SimpleAPI project is also running alongside Crossword (in a seperate VS instance perhaps).

Enjoy!

Todo:
Investigate this repo, and make it modular (.NET Standard or the most modern equivalent)
